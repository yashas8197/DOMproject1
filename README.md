Quote Generator
This is a simple web application that generates random quotes using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
The quotes are stored in an array of objects, allowing for easy customization and expansion.

# **Getting Started**

# **To get started with the Quote Generator project, follow the instructions below:**

1.Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2.Open the project in a code editor of your choice.
3.Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the application in action.

## **Project Structure**

The project structure is as follows:

├── index.html

├── script.js

├── styles.css

└── README.md

index.html: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for generating random quotes and updating the DOM.
styles.css: The CSS file that defines the styles for the web page.
README.md: The file you're currently reading, which provides an overview of the project.

**Customization**

The quotes in the application are stored in an array of objects in the script.js file.
To customize the quotes or add your own, you can modify the quotes array.
Each quote object should have the following properties:

quote: The actual quote text.
author: The author of the quote.
Example quote object:

javascript

{

  quote: "Example quote",
  
  author: "John Doe"
  
}

Feel free to add as many quotes as you like to the quotes array.

This project does not have any external dependencies.
It only requires a modern web browser that supports JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

**Contributing**

Contributions to the Quote Generator project are welcome! If you have any ideas, improvements, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

**Usage**

Upon opening the index.html file in a web browser, you will see a simple interface with a "Generate Quote" button.
